# voice-assistant-apps/shared/core/AudioStreamer.js â€“ consolidate with VoiceAssistantCore

AudioStreamer duplicates authentication/token logic present in VoiceAssistantCore.
Shared helper `ws-utils.js` will provide `getAuthToken` so both modules rely on one source.
Paves the way for deeper streaming logic consolidation.
