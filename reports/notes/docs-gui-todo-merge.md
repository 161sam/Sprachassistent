# docs/GUI-TODO -> TODO-Index

- Reviewed `docs/GUI-TODO.md` items for layout, design, and animation.
- Summarized them into two tasks: layout/design refresh and animations.
- Added both tasks to `TODO-Index.md` under Frontend (low priority).
- Removed legacy document and archived it for reference.
- Recorded deprecation entry to trace where the tasks moved.
